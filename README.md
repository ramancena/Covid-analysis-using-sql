# COVID-19 Insights Project

## Objective:
Explore and provide insights into COVID-19 data from January 2020 to July 2021, focusing on deaths and vaccinations worldwide.

## Steps:

1. **Table Creation:**
   - Created two tables, `covid_deaths` and `covid_vaccination`, to store data on deaths and vaccinations.

2. **Dataset Loading:**
   - Utilized the MySQL Command Line Client to load datasets into the created tables.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Updated date formats for consistency in both tables.

4. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Conducted exploratory analysis using MySQL queries.
   - Determined the total number of lines in both `covid_deaths` and `covid_vaccination` tables.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains information on COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations, covering various aspects such as total cases, new cases, total tests, and vaccination details for different countries and continents.

## Findings:
The project provides insights into the scale of COVID-19 impact, offering a comprehensive overview of deaths and vaccination trends.

This analysis serves as a valuable resource for gaining a better understanding of the global response to the pandemic.
